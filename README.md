# CyberEd-AI-Assessments

This repository explores the use of **Large Language Models (LLMs)**—such as GPT-4—to automatically generate cybersecurity assessments aligned clearly with educational learning objectives.

---

## 🚀 **Project Overview**
Cybersecurity education relies heavily on accurate and clear assessments.  
This research investigates whether AI-generated assessments can achieve better alignment, clarity, and effectiveness compared to traditional, human-created assessments.

## 🎯 **Goals of This Project**
- Generate cybersecurity assessments using **GPT-4**.
- Evaluate alignment of AI-generated assessments with **Bloom's Taxonomy**.
- Compare **AI-generated assessments** to **human-created assessments** in terms of clarity, educational effectiveness, and alignment.

## 🛠️ **Technologies Currently Used**
- GPT-4 (OpenAI)
- Python (planned implementations)
- Explainability frameworks (LIME, SHAP - upcoming)

## ⏳ **Current Status**
- Actively under development and experimentation.
- Regular updates will be provided.
